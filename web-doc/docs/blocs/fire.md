# FIRE Description

## Description

Fire is an OMI host FPGA reference design based on the [OpenCAPI 3.1 Transaction and Data Layer Architecture Specification](https://opencapi.org/technical/specifications/).

The design was developed to be used in an "[Apollo](../apollo)" card.

This "[Apollo](../apollo/)" card was developed for use in doing post-silicon  validation of OMI memory buffers as well as various DDIMM provider without the need for having an actual processor piece of silicon to drive the OMI traffic.

A branch "[vcu128_enablement](https://github.com/opencapi/omi_host_fire/tree/vcu128_enablement)" has been created to allow usage of Fire in a VCU128 board with a FMC+ connector and an adaptation board.

Check for enablement information on the [enablement page](../enablement)
