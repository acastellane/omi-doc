It uses \"github pages\" and this site is hosted by Github. The documentation source files are written in Markdown format. With MkDocs tool, the generated site files (html files) are automatically pushed into a specific branch gh-pages of the git repository. Installation 1. Install python and pip python and pip 2. Install mkdocs-bootswatch pip install mkdocs-bootswatch Please refer to bootswatch for more information. 3. Install a markdown editor You can simply edit the markdown (.md) files by any text editor, but it's better to user a professional markdown editor. typora . It supports all of the platforms (Windows/MacOS/Linux). Please configure typora to strict Markdown mode. That ensures you get the same output effects on both typora and mkdocs . vscode . It's also a good editor and has abundant functions and extensions. You can install extensions of Markdown, Preview and Spell checker. 4. Install other optional tools pdf2svg: This tool can convert a pdf lossless picture to svg format. For Mac OS, it can be easily installed by Homebrew , simply by brew install pdf2svg . Alternative choice is Inkscape which is a free drawing tool and can help you draw and convert vector graphics. Website Structure First, you need to git clone the oc-accel repository and go to web-doc directory. Make sure you are working on a branch other than master. $ git clone git@github.com:OpenCAPI/oc-accel-doc.git $ cd oc-accel/web-doc Create a branch if needed: $ git branch <new-branch-name> $ git checkout <A branch other than master> The docs folder is where to put the markdown files, and the mkdocs.yml lists the website structure and global definitons. For example, this site has a structure like: nav: - Home: 'index.md' - User Guide: - 'Prepare Environment': 'user-guide/prepare-env.md' - 'Run an example': 'user-guide/run-example.md' - 'Create a new action': 'user-guide/new-action.md' - 'Co-Simulation': 'user-guide/co-simulation.md' - 'FPGA Image build': 'user-guide/make-image.md' - 'Optimize HLS action': 'user-guide/optimize-hls.md' - 'Deploy on Power Server': 'user-guide/deploy.md' - 'Debug an issue': 'user-guide/debug-issue.md' - 'Command Reference': 'user-guide/command-reference.md' - Examples: - 'hdl_example': 'actions-doc/hdl-example.md' - 'hdl_helloworld': 'actions-doc/hdl-helloworld.md' - 'hls_helloworld_1024': 'actions-doc/hls-helloworld_1024.md' - 'hls_memcopy': 'actions-doc/hls-memcopy.md' - Deep Dive: - 'SNAP Software API': 'deep-dive/libosnap.md' - 'SNAP Registers': 'deep-dive/registers.md' - 'SNAP Logic Design': 'deep-dive/snap_core.md' - 'New Board Support': 'deep-dive/board-package.md' - Misc: - 'Document Guide': 'misc/doc-guide.md' You can edit them as needed. Write Markdown pages On your local desktop, edit markdown files under web-doc/docs folder. If you want to add/delete/rename the files, you also need to edit mkdocs.yml Now it's time to work with an editor (i.e, typora) to write the documents. You also may need to learn some markdown syntax. Don't worry, that's easy. And please turn on the \"spell checking\" in your Markdown editor. In your terminal (MacOS or Linux), or cmd (Windows), start a serve process: # enter in the directory where mkdocs.yml is located cd ~/oc-accel-doc/web-doc #launch a local webserver to test your mods mkdocs serve Then open a web browser, input http://127.0.0.1:8000 . So whenever you save any markdown files, you can check the generated website immediately. Play with pictures The first rule Reduce the usage of pictures. Avoid unnecessary screenshots. It's quite easy You can insert jpg, png, svg files. You can also simply copy paste pictures from clipboard and paste them. Copy the files into a directory ./${filename}.assets , and here ${filename} is the name of markdown file. Use relative links in the document. Note If you are using Typora, please enable \"Copy images into ./${filename}.assets folder\" in Preferences of typora. Tools to draw diagrams You can take any drawing tools to create diagrams. You can save them as PNG format, but the better way is to save to SVG format. For the diagrams from Microsoft PowerPoint, you can select the region of a diagram in PPT, Ctrl-C to copy it, and Ctrl-V to paste it in Typora directly. In this case, the diagram is saved as an PNG file. But there is a better way to get the smallest file size and best quality: In PowerPoint, select the region of diagram, right-click mouse -> \"Save as Picture ...\" and save it as \"PDF\" format. Open the PDF file with Inkscape . (Right-click the file -> \"Open with ...\", choose Inkscape in the poped up list). Unclick \"Embed images\" and then \"OK\". In Inkscape, save it as SVG file. Insert the SVG file into Typora. In my experiment, the PNG file is 188KB. But with the above flow to save it as SVG file, its size is 62KB. As a vectored diagram, it doesn't have any quality loss when zooming in. Warning Please use normal fonts in PPT, for example \"Arial\". Otherwise you may get a SVG file with a replaced font and that may look different. Code blocks and Admonitions Code blocks Please assign the code language so it can be correctly rendered. For example ``` C for C language. // A function to implement bubble sort void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n) { int i, j; for (i = 0; i < n-1; i++) // Last i elements are already in place for (j = 0; j < n-i-1; j++) if (arr[j] > arr[j+1]) swap(&arr[j], &arr[j+1]); } Admonitions You can use !!! Note or !!! Warning or !!! Danger to start a paragraph of admonitions. Then use 4 spaces to start the admonition text. For example !!! Danger \"Error Message\" This is a dangerous error. It will be shown as: Error Message This is a dangerous error. Deploy to Github Pages When most of the edition work is done, and it's time to commit your documents to oc-accel github. First, you should commit and push your changes of source files (in web-doc ) to git repository. Create pull request, ask someone to review the documents, merge them into master branch after getting approvements. Then you can simply publish website with just one step: cd <PATH>/oc-accel-doc/web-doc mkdocs gh-deploy The entire website will be pushed to gh-pages branch of omi-doc repository.
