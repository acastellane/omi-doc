# FIRE Description

## Description

Fire is a OMI host FPGA design.

Initial design was developed to populate the Apollo card.

A branch "no-[encrypt_vcu128](https://github.com/acastellane/omi_host_fire/tree/no_encrypt_vcu128)" has been created to allow usage of Fire in a VCU128 board with a FMC+ connector and an adaptation board.
